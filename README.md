# Java Concurrency
The purpose of this repository is to show different problems with concurrent programming in Java.

For each case we are going to show a problem related with concurrency, and the proposed solution with Java to avoid the problem.

Here is the index of different examples:

## Executors

1. [Single Thread without Result](https://github.com/jjmena/java-concurrency/tree/master/src/com/example/concurrency/executor_single_thread_without_result)
2. [Single Thread with Result](https://github.com/jjmena/java-concurrency/tree/master/src/com/example/concurrency/executor_single_thread_with_result)
3. [Multi Thread](https://github.com/jjmena/java-concurrency/tree/master/src/com/example/concurrency/executor_multi_thread)
4. [Multi Thread Awaiting for all tasks](https://github.com/jjmena/java-concurrency/tree/master/src/com/example/concurrency/executor_awaiting_for_all_tasks)
5. [Schedule executor](https://github.com/jjmena/java-concurrency/tree/master/src/com/example/concurrency/schedule_executor_single_thread)

## Synchronization

1. [Basic Synchronization](https://github.com/jjmena/java-concurrency/tree/master/src/com/example/concurrency/basic_synchronization)
2. [Concurrent Lock](https://github.com/jjmena/java-concurrency/tree/master/src/com/example/concurrency/concurrent_lock_usage)
3. [CountDownLatch](https://github.com/jjmena/java-concurrency/tree/master/src/com/example/concurrency/countdownlatch_usage)
4. [CyclicBarrier](https://github.com/jjmena/java-concurrency/tree/master/src/com/example/concurrency/cyclicbarrier_usage)

## Other stuff

1. [Future results](https://github.com/jjmena/java-concurrency/tree/master/src/com/example/concurrency/future_check_results)
2. [Future results with timeout](https://github.com/jjmena/java-concurrency/tree/master/src/com/example/concurrency/future_check_results_with_timeout)
3. [Completable Future](https://github.com/jjmena/java-concurrency/tree/master/src/com/example/concurrency/completable_future_usage)
4. [Parallel Streams](https://github.com/jjmena/java-concurrency/tree/master/src/com/example/concurrency/parallel_streams)
5. [Volatile keyword](https://github.com/jjmena/java-concurrency/tree/master/src/com/example/concurrency/volatile_usage)
6. [Fork/Join Pool]()
